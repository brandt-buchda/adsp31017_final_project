sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that like faith, doubt can be a unifying force. sister aloysius, the strict principal of the parish school, becomes concerned when she sees a boy pull away from father flynn in the school courtyard. at dinner, she asks her fellow nuns if they know why father flynn would preach about doubt, and instructs them to be alert to a possible problem in the school.\\r\\none day during class, sister james, a young and naive teacher, receives a request for donald miller, an altar boy and the school's only black student, to meet father flynn in the rectory. when he returns, donald is upset and sister james notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. later, she sees father flynn placing an undershirt in donald's locker. she reports her suspicions to sister aloysius.\\r\\nsisters aloysius and james confront father flynn. several times, he asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but sister aloysius persists. finally, he is pressured into saying that donald had been caught drinking altar wine and that he will now need to be dismissed as an altar boy. sister james is relieved and believes father flynn's explanation, but sister aloysius is not convinced.\\r\\nfather flynn gives a sermon on bearing false witness and gossip. sister james asks him about the shirt he put in donald's locker, an observation she had kept from sister aloysius. father flynn explains that the boy had left the shirt in the sacristy, and that he had put it in the locker to spare the boy additional embarrassment. flynn goes on to say that it is he, not sister aloysius, that really cares about the boy.\\r\\nsister aloysius meets with donald miller's mother regarding her suspicions. mrs. miller shocks sister aloysius with her lack of interest in the alleged misconduct on father flynn's part. as far as she is concerned, donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. it is hinted that donald is homosexual and that his father is physically abusive because of it. mrs. miller begs sister aloysius to leave donald out of her campaign against father flynn.\\r\\nfather flynn demands that sister aloysius stop trying to destroy his reputation. sister aloysius responds that he must confess and resign. father flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but sister aloysius claims that she has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved to three different parishes in the last five years. she tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches, who corroborated her suspicions. father flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church pastor, which is proper church protocol. sister aloysius threatens to visit his previous parishes and contact parents if necessary. father flynn agrees to request a transfer.\\r\\nfollowing his final sermon, father flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. some time later, sisters aloysius and james are sitting together in the church garden. sister aloysius tells sister james that despite her warning, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church with a parochial school, promoting him to a more prestigious position and perpetuating the problem. she admits to having lied about speaking to a nun at father flynn's former church, saying it would not have worked if he was innocent. sister aloysius concludes that she has paid a price in pursuing the wrongdoing of father flynn. she breaks down in tears and says to sister james: \\\"i have doubts...i have such doubts.\\\"\",\n          \"waking inside a laboratory on an airship, a man recalls bullies from his childhood. a scientist, estelle (haley bennett), greets him and says his name is henry, she is his wife, and that he has been revived from an accident that left him amnesiac and mute. after she replaces a missing arm and leg with cybernetic prostheses, mercenaries led by the psychokinetic akan (danila kozlovsky) raid the ship, claiming all of estelle's research is akan's corporate property. he kills estelle's scientists before attempting to murder henry, but henry and estelle flee in an escape pod, landing in moscow. estelle is abducted by the mercenaries, who try to kill henry.\\r\\nhenry is rescued by a mysterious man, jimmy (sharlto copley), who informs him that his cybernetic implants are running out of power, which will kill him if he can't recharge. jimmy is killed by corrupt cops bought out by akan, and henry is forced to fight his way through both cops and mercenaries, sneaking onto a bus. he is joined by jimmy \\u2014 not dead, now an alcoholic, odorous bum \\u2014 who informs him that one of akan's associates, slick dimitry, has a cybernetic charging pump implanted, which henry needs to recharge. the two are attacked by a flamethrower-wielding goon. jimmy is incinerated, but henry escapes, locating and chasing dimitry throughout moscow before capturing him; just as dimitry promises him information, he is killed by a sniper. henry removes the pump and receives a call from jimmy, who directs henry to a brothel.\\r\\nhenry meets two more versions of jimmy \\u2014 a cocaine-addicted lothario and a shy, awkward geek \\u2014 who replace his pump. the brothel is attacked by akan's forces. henry fights his way through, but encounters akan, who taunts him with estelle's kidnapping, revealing she is being transported by an armored convoy. akan hurls henry out of the brothel.\\r\\noutside, henry encounters another jimmy \\u2014 now a marijuana-obsessed hippie-biker \\u2014 who transports him to akan's convoy. henry finds estelle - and akan, who (seemingly) kills him and buries him in the woods.\\r\\njimmy finds and resuscitates henry, only to be shelled by a tank. after killing the tank crew, fending off a helicopter, and failing to ride a runaway horse, henry finds another jimmy \\u2014 a gruff sniper in a ghillie suit \\u2014 who leads him to an abandoned hotel, where jimmy is headquartered in a hidden laboratory. jimmy and henry encounter a number of policemen surrounding a girl. they are in the process of forcing her to perform oral sex on one of the cops. henry kills them all. here, the real jimmy \\u2014 a quadriplegic scientist \\u2014 reveals his motive for helping henry: revenge against akan, who crippled him after his own cyborg super-soldiers failed. he reveals the other jimmys are dormant clones that he can control, through which he lives a vice-filled life. the clones attack henry after jimmy realizes that henry has been unknowingly broadcasting his location to akan, with a strike force closing in. fending off jimmy, henry convinces him to help. henry and the clones of jimmy \\u2014 ranging from a punk rocker to a posh wwii colonel \\u2014 fight their way out, killing the force by collapsing the laboratory on them.\\r\\njimmy and henry drive to akan's headquarters. they fight their way into an elevator, but jimmy is mortally wounded. before dying, jimmy thanks henry for being the closest thing to a friend he had, and removes a memory blocker, gradually restoring henry's memories. henry fights his way to the highest floor, where he is greeted by akan, revealing an army of cyborg super-soldiers being fed henry's memories. one such soldier fights henry, followed by the rest of the army, chasing henry to the roof.\\r\\nhenry wipes out the entire army. akan arrives and severely wounds henry. shortly after, estelle arrives as well. in reality, estelle was akan's wife, forming an elaborate ruse to field-test henry and use his memories to manipulate cyborg soldiers into doing anything to \\\"rescue\\\" their \\\"wife\\\" \\u2014 specifically, terrorist attacks and world domination as akan's loyal slaves. the two leave henry for dead, leaving in a helicopter. henry blacks out, but is energized by an emerging memory of his father (tim roth) encouraging him to fight back against the childhood bullies seen in the intro. henry manages to reach akan, decapitating him with his cybernetic eyestalk. he jumps onto estelle's helicopter, presenting her akan's head. estelle shoots him, but the bullet ricochets off his cybernetic hand and wounds her, leaving her hanging from the helicopter. estelle pleads with henry to save her, but henry slams the door, sending her falling to her death.\\r\\nmid-credits, an answering machine message from jimmy is heard, telling henry there is \\\"one more thing\\\" to do.\",\n          \"during the first ice age, a caveman attempts to make fire with his girlfriend. an earthquake causes a cave-in that buries the two of them.\\r\\nthis segues into a present-day los angeles earthquake that awakens average teenager dave morgan. he, along with his best friend stoney, strives to attain popularity in high school but comes off more as a reject and an outcast. dave is in love with robyn sweeney, a sweet and attractive girl who has been his best friend since grade school, and, until she reached adolescence, had been rejected by dave on several occasions. her boyfriend, matt wilson, is a stereotypical athlete and school bully who is constantly responsible for making both dave and stoney the objects of ridicule by humiliating them in various ways, usually directly due to dave's growing affections toward robyn.\\r\\none day, as dave is digging a pool in his backyard, he comes across a chunk of ice that has the body of a man in it following an earthquake. they leave the ice block unattended in the garage and space heaters left on cause the ice to melt, releasing the caveman from the opening of the film. the caveman falls head first into the 20th century, discovering a garbage truck which he misinterprets as a mammoth from his time, and television which he discovers upon entering dave's house. when the boys return home, they find hand paint covering the walls and the house is in disarray. investigating a beeping smoke alarm, they discover the caveman in dave's bedroom, attempting to start a fire \\\"indian-style\\\" by rotating a stick in the center of a pile of kindling. at first, the caveman panics at the sight of them, but then stoney quickly calms him by using the flame of a lighter to mesmerize him after he panics from the phone ringing. after bathing him and trimming him to look like an average teenager, dave names him \\\"link\\\" as in the missing link.\\r\\nthey manage to fool dave's family into thinking he is actually an estonian exchange student sent to live with them, and enroll him in school where link's bizarre behavior and supreme athletic skills shoot dave and stoney to popularity by association, allowing dave to get closer to robyn, to matt's chagrin. it soon becomes apparent that stoney's bizarre attitude is having an effect on link's actions and speech, which causes a rift between dave and stoney and after a fight with matt at a skating rink, as well as an attraction developing between robyn and link. during a school field trip to a natural history museum, link gets upset realizing that the cavepeople he knew are all dead and the gravity of his situation, but stoney and dave console link that he is not without friends in this time, causing the trio to make a pact. dave tries to send link away, but a fight between him and stoney cause link to come running back. stoney and dave then make up. on prom night, link is a hit at the party with robyn as his date while dave stays in for the evening. matt breaks into dave's bedroom and steals photographic evidence that link is a caveman. as dave and stoney go after matt and his friends, another earthquake happens. at the prom, matt's plan to uncover the \\\"freak\\\" backfires as the information instead makes link even more popular. dave and robyn make up, and the three boys lead the entire prom in an impromptu caveman-like dance.\\r\\nafter the prom, the students attend dave's house for a pool party where dave and robyn kiss. meanwhile, stoney and link follow clues similar to when they found him ranging from breast prints on the slider and paint covering the walls. they follow the muddy footprints to the bathroom and discover a beautiful cavewoman in the bathtub who turns out to be link's girlfriend from the beginning of the film. he joins her in the bathtub as stoney cheers them on and embraces her happily as she is also made to look like a modern human.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"genre\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":
